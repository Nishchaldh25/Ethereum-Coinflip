# Ethereum-Coinflip
A blockchain-based Coinflip game built on the Ethereum testnet. Users can connect their wallet, place bets with test tokens (ETH), and flip a coin. The smart contract determines the outcome, doubling the bet if the user wins. Fully decentralized and hosted on Vercel with MetaMask wallet integration.
